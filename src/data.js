/*
  Deckbound — src/data.js
  Constants + the balance-data merge. Loads first (after balance.data.js).

  window.BALANCE (generated from data/balance.json by tools/gen_balance.py)
  carries every gameplay number; this file merges it with the art-only tables
  (colors/glow/radius) into TOWER_TYPES / ENEMY_TYPES and exposes RULES.
  Nothing here touches the DOM. If the balance sim needs a number, it lives in
  data/balance.json — never here.

// The BOARD coordinate space — the engine, maps, placement bounds, the sim, and
// every gameplay position live here. It is SACRED: never change these numbers.
// tools/sim.mjs runs the engine headless against this exact VIEW, so any drift
// here is a balance drift. The engine's only VIEW use is particle culling at the
// board edge (engine.js) — a board-space bound, not a chrome dependency.
const VIEW = { w: 800, h: 450 };

// Landscape mobile-first chrome (Issue #79). On a phone the whole board scaled
// down, so upgrade buttons were tiny. The fix is a presentation-only VIEWPORT
// TRANSFORM: the DESIGN canvas is wider than the board so the tower deck lives
// in a LEFT RAIL and the upgrade panel slides in as a RIGHT SHEET — chrome OFF
// the board, big touch targets kept. The renderer offsets the 800x450 board
// right by BOARD.x (a single ctx.translate) and input maps the inverse; the
// board's coordinate space is UNCHANGED, so engine/sim/placement never see this.
