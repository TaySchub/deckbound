# Changelog

All notable changes to Blue-Plate Special (formerly Deckbound) are recorded here. Newest at the top.
Format is deliberately simple and plain-language.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Tower Rework stage 2 — five newcomer kits rebuilt on the new systems**
  (Issue #103). The Pitmaster keeps his lock-on ramping smoke and gains two
  real poles: The Stall (t1 much faster + deeper stacking, t2 an AMBIENT
  SMOKE AURA around the smoker) vs Whole Hog (t1 pure reach, t2 smokes TWO
  dishes at once — dual lock, count frozen). Ranch is now **The Syrup
  Slinger** (display rename only; internal id `ranch` frozen): the cone +
  stacking coats are gone — she slings a maple-syrup glob for an immediate,
  strong, refreshable glue-slow with ZERO damage (pure control; the
  Photographer keeps the hard stop). Quick Pour t2 = the Syrup Trail (a glued
  dish that's eaten leaves a belt puddle gluing up to 3 passers, frozen);
  The Big Bottle t2 globs 3 at once (frozen). The Sample Lady is PURE
  SUPPORT: no attack at all — her aura (radius = her range, so the stock
  ghost ring shows it) hastes nearby customers and cuts their upgrade prices
  10% (the sheet shows the real discounted price), with +damage (Happy Hour)
  and value-tag / stronger-haste (On the House) tiers; her old invisible amp
  math, stun, and the brand-skirting path name are all retired. The
  Short-Order Cook's knockback-chance (the roster's only RNG signature) is
  deleted — Seasoned Griddle t2 is now "Stove on High", a pure damage tier.
  The Competitive Eater keeps his combo base-only: Water Dunk is the pure
  speed pole (guarded by a new bite-cooldown FLOOR so haste can't runaway),
  and The Tip Jar t2 pays a flat jackpot on every Nth kill — a deterministic
  counter, never a chance roll. SAVES NEVER BREAK: checkpoints are
  version-stamped (v2 adds per-tower spend), a save on a retired path
  restores with the tower KEPT and the orphaned tiers refunded at FULL
  pre-rework value, and any malformed save lands safely in the hub with META
  intact. All shelf values — stage 3 is the tuning pass; the CI gate block
  stays byte-identical to main through this stage.
- **Tower Rework stage 1 — two shared engine systems, provably inert**
  (Issue #103). Enemy-side ZONE APPLICATORS (a tower-centered ambient aura +
  belt puddles with a lifetime and a distinct-passer capacity) that apply
  statuses through the existing #91 status layer, including the new
  refreshable glue-slow; and TOWER-PROXIMITY SUPPORT EFFECTS (one radius
  check → attack-haste, +damage, and an upgrade discount that hooks the real
  tryUpgrade price AND the sheet's displayed chip). Zero Math.random
  anywhere; all config shipped neutral, gate + roster boards + both smokes
  byte-identical to main at this commit. New behavior tests: zones,
  proximity.
- **The succession: the working model is now written for the post-Fable era**
  (Issue #101; docs + agent files ONLY — zero game-file changes, gate and
  smokes untouched by construction). The governing docs were rewritten from
  the complete #59–#97 paper trail so the proven method survives the model
  transition: `CLAUDE.md` now documents the real three-seat model (planner /
  builder / reviewer chats, all Opus 4.8, developer as the only merge gate),
  replacing the never-used Sonnet-orchestrator/escalation-ladder framing, with
  the repo map + code landmarks brought current (10 towers, status layer,
  save & continue, menu system). New: `docs/CHECKPOINT.md` (the review recipe
  reverse-engineered from the nine checkpoint verdicts + the when-required
  policy table, incl. `/code-review ultra` as the sanctioned top-tier
  depth-boost), `docs/PLAYBOOK.md` (the portable game-agnostic methodology +
  the evidence-based new-game bootstrap sequence), and `docs/kickoffs/`
  (seven files: fill-in templates for the six proven PR shapes + the
  parallel-run file contract). `.claude/agents/` consolidated six stale role
  files into three seat briefs. `AUTONOMY.md` rewritten to match the five
  overnights that actually ran (one chat, one ratified kickoff, park-don't-
  grind); `PROJECT.md` process-law edits (developer-authorized this run,
  each listed in the PR). Owed riders paid: the #93 checkpoint ruling folded
  into `BALANCE_PHILOSOPHY` §4 (the cross-roster ≤12 swap-in bar is RETIRED
  as position-confounded; sibling ≤8 + role benches + no-domination stand),
  the §3 cliff list (frost `slowDur` 3.0, the birthday/fork integer cliffs),
  and the ≥52%-at-CI-config bar written into §4.

- **The game is now Blue-Plate Special, with a real main menu** (Issue #96;
  Implementer + Art hats; display + shell only — zero gameplay changes, the
  difficulty gauge and both smokes byte-identical to main, the only sim-output
  diff being the flagship map's printed display name).
  - **Display rename** (developer-ratified 2026-07-07): page title/header,
    README (+ repo/Pages URLs to TaySchub/blueplate), SETUP-AND-LAUNCH,
    harness titles, GAME_BRIEF header (the one authorized law edit), and
    display-ish doc mentions. The flagship map's display name became **"The
    Original"** (the title owns the name now). FROZEN by design: all internal
    ids (map id `blueplate`, tower/enemy/path ids), the `deckbound.*`
    localStorage keys (renaming loses saves), tool flags, CI/branch names,
    `src/engine.js` entirely, and PROJECT.md (law; edit not authorized).
  - **The wordmark**: an enamel diner sign drawn vector in art.js
    (`drawWordmark`) — cream board, navy rim, teal neon edge-glow, the
    blue-plate-with-fork badge, "SPECIAL" on a red ribbon, mustard star
    sparks. Palette promoted to named `COLOR.sign*` entries (data.js).
  - **The menu system**: the single hub became three diner-styled screens
    (shell `menuScreen` state; the engine's phase "menu" untouched). **MAIN**:
    the wordmark + Continue — Wave N (above Play, with the saved map's name) +
    Open for Service (keeps the discards-save hint) + Towers + Shop + mute.
    **TOWERS**: a scrollable codex (the rail's drag/wheel scroll pattern, one
    geometry source) listing all 10 towers — portrait, name, cost, role blurb,
    BOTH paths with the #94 tier descriptions verbatim and tier costs; the
    unbought Slurper shows locked with its shop hint. **SHOP**: the Golden
    Forks balance + the same three items/purchase logic on their own page.
    Every interactive rect ≥44 CSS px at ~844×390 (audited: worst menu rect
    45.4). Save & Continue drilled end-to-end through the new menu (hard-close
    mid-wave → Continue — Wave 1 → exact wave-start board restored).


### Fixed
- **Chrome polish for the 10-tower roster** (Issue #94, display-only — zero numeric
  or mechanic changes; the gate and both smokes are byte-identical to main). Four
  real-device (phone landscape) fixes:
  - **Hub deck no longer overflows or truncates names.** "Your regulars" was laid
    out as a single row for 5 short names; it now **wraps to a 2-row grid** (5×2 at
    10 towers, headroom for ~12) and every name renders in full — cards shrink the
    font and wrap to 2 lines rather than ellipsize. Tap-for-details is now a **modal
    popover** showing the blurb and both upgrade paths with each tier's description.
  - **Rail names render in full in-game.** The left-rail cards wrap to 2 lines with a
    per-card shrink-to-fit font, so "Short-Order Cook" / "Competitive Eater" /
    "Milkshake Slurper" read cleanly (verified with headroom for a 19-char future
    name like "Hot-Sauce Daredevil"). Cards are a touch taller; the rail still scrolls.
  - **Upgrade descriptions in the tower sheet.** Every upgrade tier gained a short,
    plain-language description in `data/balance.json` (~40 one-liners, behavior-accurate
    to the current deltas/signatures, no staleable numbers). The right-side sheet's
    path rows now show the relevant tier's line (next purchase, or the bought tier
    when maxed; a locked-out path shows what it would have done, dimmed); rows grew and
    the sheet reflowed with the Sell row still reachable. The hub popover uses the same
    strings.
  - **Tutorial hint clears the HUD.** The prep hint now sits on its own backing pill
    below the HUD readout bar, so it never overlaps the HUD chips at phone size (the
    standing PR #81 nit).
  All interactive rects still clear 44 CSS px at ~844×390 (hub/rail cards 55, path
  rows 62, targeting/sell 45). `src/engine.js` and the tests are untouched.

### Changed
- **Deep rebalance: every one of the 10 towers now earns its seat** (Issue
  #92, stage 2; Designer hat). Numbers only — 42 values in
  `data/balance.json`, no engine change. The five Roster Growth newcomers
  were shelf-priced and probe-dead (a one-of-everything board read 0%
  survival while the all-originals reference read 57%); each is now
  measurably best at its role-map claim: the Pitmaster deals the most damage
  into a crossing Tough Steak (Tank Melter, reach 150), the Ranch Fountain
  out-brakes every seat across a crowd, the Competitive Eater out-kills
  everything on a fed lane once ramped, the Short-Order Cook out-streams the
  mid band (now 350), and the Sample Lady's two paths both pull their
  weight. The over-curve Slurper swap-in (+24 over reference) was reined in
  (500 Tips, cd 0.16, reach 135 — tier ranges no longer rebuild it), Big
  Appetite's decayed bite got its burst back (100), and the all-signature
  stack premium came down +20 → +11 mostly via two +50 signature-tier cost
  dampers (identities untouched; the crumb splash is the one trimmed
  magnitude). Gate: 55.0% at the CI config (55.6/58.8/54.2 across seed
  bases at 500 sims; 56.6% at 1000) — new smoke baselines quoted in the PR.
  Income model unchanged by design and now written down as policy
  (`docs/BALANCE_PHILOSOPHY.md`): dual stream, size-scaled bounties, flat
  recovery floor, no decay brackets, no eco tower, no interest.

### Added
- **Balance philosophy + roster probe visibility** (Issue #92, stage 1;
  Designer + Researcher hats). New `docs/BALANCE_PHILOSOPHY.md` — the tuning
  north star: a researched income-model comparison (BTD6's dual stream,
  Kingdom Rush's leak-pay, Defense Grid's interest cautionary, Dungeon
  Warfare's copy-pricing) and what Deckbound adopts against its own
  constraints; a ROLE MAP giving each of the 10 towers a named role, a cost
  band, and ONE measurable best-at claim with its probe; and pricing/bounty
  rubric v2 (supersedes #87's). CLAUDE.md's doc map points at it.
  `tools/sim.mjs --check` now also prints three data-defined REPORT-ONLY
  roster boards (`modern-mix`, `support-stack`, `dot-board`) after the gate
  blocks — newcomer compositions visible in every CI log, zero effect on the
  gate or exit code (gate output verified byte-identical, 57.0% blueplate /
  34.5% retired diner).
- **Roster Growth 2 — three status towers: the Pitmaster, the Ranch Fountain,
  and the Sample Lady** (stage 2; Implementer + Designer + Art hats). All three
  ride the stage-1 status layer, ship INSTANTLY available (the unlocked-set
  union migration hands them to veteran saves), and sit beside the gate — the
  reference build is untouched, so the difficulty gauge and both smokes stay
  byte-identical to main.
  - **The Pitmaster** (`pit`, mid band 300): a lone obsessive behind a long
    offset smoker. Locks one dish (the Slurper's lock machinery) and bastes it
    with stacking low-and-slow smoke — dps rides the stack count. *The Stall*
    (250/550): faster stacking → **Burnt Ends** (a killed dish's smoke carries
    over: the next lock starts pre-stacked; a LEAKED dish carries nothing).
    *Competition Rub* (250/550): +2 stack cap → **Probe Tender** (a
    fully-stacked dish at ≤15% HP is finished on the spot — a one-line execute
    through the normal death path, bounty paid).
  - **The Ranch Fountain** (`ranch`, mid band 300): a tall fountain cascading
    ranch, tended by a superfan. Sprays a **CONE** (new targeting shape; the
    math lives in one `inCone` helper) coating every dish in it: stacking slow
    (per-stack strength, floor-capped) + a light drizzle DOT. *Extra Dressing*
    (250/550): deeper slow per coat → **Ranch on Everything** (the drizzle
    ramps with the coats). *Wider Nozzle* (250/600): wider/longer cone →
    **Ranch Keg** (every 5s the spray drenches the whole cone to instant max
    slow).
  - **The Sample Lady** (`sample`, cheap band 150): a demo cart with toothpick
    trays. Offers a sample: a tiny nibble, a brief **plain stun** (freezeTimer
    reuse — deliberately no Photographer brackets; a `freezePlain` flag keeps
    the snapshot language hers alone), and the **AMP mark** so every customer
    hits that dish harder — the roster's first true force-multiplier. *Costco
    Saturday* (150/250): faster sampling → **Loss Leader** (marked dishes pay
    +10 Tips on death). *Hard Sell* (150/300): stronger mark → **Bulk Buy**
    (marks up to 3 dishes in a small radius).
  - Pricing follows the #87 rubric (cheap 150 / mid 300; t1 ≈ one midgame
    wave's income; crowd-multiplier signature t2s +50 over siblings). Art in
    house style — two stations-with-people and a tall prop-with-person, three
    new signature colors (hickory `#a06a3a`, buttermilk `#f2e8cf`, sample-cart
    pink `#ff8fb5`). Report-only probes: solo 10x boards die at median waves
    17/6/5 (supports don't carry — by design); adding one Sample Lady to
    arrow+cannon lifts median 20→21 and P(reach 20) 96.5%→100% (the amp made
    visible). Tests: `pitmaster.test.mjs`, `ranch.test.mjs`, `sample.test.mjs`.
    Verified: gate + both smokes byte-identical to main at BOTH stage
    boundaries (blueplate 57.0%; smoke 22/3575 stat, 22/3265 signature); all
    tests + maplint green.
- **The enemy STATUS layer** (Roster Growth 2, stage 1; Implementer hat) — the
  generic gateway the researched status towers ride, shipped PROVABLY INERT
  (no tower applies a status yet). Two effects, scoped to exactly what stage 2
  uses: stacking **DOTs** (per-source-kind entries with a stack cap, duration
  refresh on reapply, flat + per-stack dps, optional per-stack slow with a
  floor — ticked every 0.5s through the NORMAL damage path so bounties, kill
  credit, and amp all apply) and the **AMP vulnerability mark** (multiplier on
  all damage taken; non-stacking, strongest wins, duration refreshes; carries
  an optional bonus-Tips-on-death payload). Statuses are plain fields on the
  enemy object (the slowTimer precedent); bookkeeping consumes zero
  Math.random; `FX.statusApply`/`FX.statusTick` hooks are no-op headless and
  wired in main.js (apply borrows the light hit tick; tick stays silent — its
  damage already plays the normal hit). Render shows subtle cues via
  `drawStatusCues`: smoke curls / creamy ranch drips / a gold sample flag.
  Behavior test: `tools/tests/status.test.mjs`. Verified inert: gate + both
  smokes byte-identical to main (blueplate 57.0%, diner 34.5% report-only;
  smoke 22/3575 stat, 22/3265 signature).
- **Roster Growth 1 — a scrolling tower rail + two new towers** (Implementer +
  Designer + Art hats). The left rail now **scrolls** once the deck outgrows the 5
  cards it fits (7 today, ~12 planned): drag/swipe on touch (with an 8px drag
  threshold so a swipe never mis-fires a build), wheel on desktop, a proportional
  scroll thumb, and top/bottom edge fades. Draw + hit-testing share one
  scroll-aware `railCardRect`; every card stays ≥44 CSS px at phone scale. Two new
  **instantly-available** towers (existing engine vocabulary only — no new status
  effects):
  - **The Short-Order Cook** (`cook`, ~300 Tips, griddle red) — a standing cook at
    a flat-top griddle who sears the 2 nearest dishes (multi-target). *Slinging
    Hash* → **Rush Ticket** (3 sears); *Seasoned Griddle* → **Order Up** (each sear
    has a chance to spatula-fling a dish backward — the existing size-scaled
    knockback).
  - **The Competitive Eater** (`eater`, ~450 Tips, contest green) — locks one dish
    and devours it; consecutive kills build a **combo** that ramps bite speed to a
    cap (tower state, resets on an empty lane). *Water Dunk* → **Solomon Method**
    (each bite lands as two half-hits); *Record Pace* → **Mustard Belt** (kills at
    max combo pay a bounty bonus).
  Both ship in the default unlocked set, and existing saves are migrated (the
  unlocked list is UNIONed with the new defaults on load, so a veteran keeps a
  purchased Slurper and gains the newcomers). Upgrade sheet, sell, save/restore,
  and maplint all handle them data-driven. Sounds reuse the closest existing FX;
  bespoke audio for the newcomers rides a future audio touch. **Content beside the
  gate, not through it:** `node tools/sim.mjs --check` is byte-identical to main
  (blueplate 57.0%, diner 34.5% retired; full output diff identical) and both smoke
  JSONs are unchanged — the new towers are never in the reference build. New
  behavior tests: `tools/tests/cook.test.mjs`, `tools/tests/eater.test.mjs`, and a
  new-type case in `save.test.mjs`.

### Changed
- **The economy is rebuilt so the game is fun from wave 1** (economy overhaul,
  stage 3; developer-ratified design, numbers only — no mechanic or upgrade
  delta moved). Everything repriced ~4-5x with real cheap/mid/premium spread:
  start **800** Tips (was 150), flat **170**/wave (was 40), towers **150-450**
  (Kids' Table 150 · Regular 250 · Photographer 300 · Big Appetite 400 ·
  Slurper 450), tiers **150-700** (full table + per-value rationale in the PR).
  Bounties are size-scaled: Fry 5 · Slider 10 · Hot Dog 15 · Steak 35 — income
  now ramps with threat automatically, and the mix lands **39/61**
  flat-to-kills with the flat floor (170 ≥ a whole Kids' Table) keeping a
  leaking board repairable every wave. Wave generation untouched (the existing
  typeUnlock schedule already ramps small→heavy). The reference now fields
  **4 towers by wave 3** (was 2 by wave 3 and broke until wave 15), makes a
  purchase **every wave 1-21** plus a save-up beat at 22 and buys through 24
  (was: done at 21 with an 8-wave dead bank), and hits its first tier-2 at
  wave 5 (cheap tower) / wave 10 (first premium tier-2). Verified: blueplate
  survival@30 **57.0%** (seed 1/200, the CI config — 5pts above the band
  floor, ending the 50.5%-on-the-floor fragility), **52.0/54.0%** at seeds
  1000/5000, **56.7%** at 1000 sims; spam probe 28.5% (width still loses);
  path-value matrix within ±4.5pts; all-signature premium re-measured +20pts
  (the known structural synergy, damped from +25.5 via the two hottest
  signature tier-2 costs); pacing median 29.5s/wave, run-to-30 14.4 sim-min;
  all tests + maplint green (sell.test.mjs now funds itself explicitly —
  behavior tests must not depend on tuned prices).
- **Economy mechanics land, provably inert** (economy overhaul, stage 2;
  developer-approved — the numbers move in stage 3):
  - **Per-kill bounties are now explicit data.** Each dish's on-kill Tips payout
    is a `bounty` field in `balance.json` `enemyTypes` (renamed from `reward`,
    values unchanged), awarded at the kill site with the existing "+$N tip"
    float; a **zero** bounty now pays nothing and floats nothing, and a leaked
    dish still pays nothing. New behavior test: `tools/tests/bounty.test.mjs`.
  - **The early-call bonus is removed end to end** — engine (`earlyCallBonusNow`
    + the `startNextWave` grant + the `FX.calledEarly` hook), `balance.json`
    economy keys, the "+N" chip on the Call Wave button (now always "Send Wave
    N"), the sim's window-lapse reference line, and the save system's
    anti-double-bonus `prepElapsed` parking (moot). One GAME_BRIEF post-v1
    bullet (the bonus's own entry) is deleted — that removal was pre-authorized.
  - **Auto-start rounds.** A pause-menu segmented row (Off / Instant / 1s / 2s /
    3s, ≥48 design px, persisted as `META.autoStart`): when set, the next wave
    calls itself that many seconds after the previous wave RESOLVES. The run's
    first prep is always manual, pausing suspends the countdown (update() halts
    at the shell), and the first prep after a save-restore skips it once — a
    breather to re-read the board. The Send Wave button shows an "auto-start in
    Ns" hint while counting. New behavior test: `tools/tests/autostart.test.mjs`.
  - **Wave-type weights moved to data.** `waveTypeWeights`' hardcoded
    coefficients now live in `balance.json` `waveGen.typeWeights`
    (base/perWave/min per type, identical values) so stage 3 can tune the wave
    ramp like every other number.
  - **Verified inert where it must be:** `node tools/sim.mjs --check`
    byte-identical to stage 1 / main (blueplate survival@30 **50.5%**, seed
    1/200); all behavior tests green (incl. the updated `save.test.mjs`);
    maplint green. The harness smoke JSONs shift slightly BY DESIGN: the smoke
    player calls every wave instantly, so it had been collecting the early-call
    bonus the reference sim never took — removing the mechanic changes its
    tips (quoted in the PR), while the difficulty gate itself is untouched.

### Removed
- **The Python second-opinion sim is retired** (economy overhaul, stage 1;
  developer-approved). `tools/balance_sim.py` (the 1-D difficulty model) and
  `tools/check_parity.py` (the wave-parity check that kept its mirrored wave
  formula honest) are deleted, along with their CI steps and `tools/sim.mjs`'s
  `--dump-waves` fixture flag (nothing else consumed it). The real-engine sim
  (`node tools/sim.mjs --check`) has been THE gate since Issue #54 PR 5; with
  the economy about to be rebuilt around real engine mechanics (per-kill
  bounties), maintaining a diverging mirror is pure drag. Docs aligned:
  `CLAUDE.md` (verification + landmarks), `SETUP-AND-LAUNCH.md`,
  `data/balance.json` `_note`, the harness hints, and the designer/qa role
  briefs now name one gauge. Verified: `--check` byte-identical to `main`
  (blueplate survival@30 **50.5%**, diner 33.0% report-only, seed 1/200).

### Fixed
- **Teenage Table tier-2 art no longer dwarfs the board** (Issue #82, Implementer
  hat). The Kids' Table's "Teenage Table" upgrade stacked a 40% whole-huddle
  scale on top of a big per-kid stretch, so a tier-2 tower drew nearly **twice**
  the height of every other tower and overhung the belt. Reined both in: the
  huddle scale drops from +20%/tier to +3%/tier and the per-kid teen stretch
  (torso / arms / hat) is roughly a fifth of its old strength. A tier-2 Teenage
  Table now reads ~12% taller than the plain Kids' Table and stays inside the
  42px booth pad — the "the kids grew up" identity (same trio, party hats, longer
  limbs, taller hats) is preserved, just proportionate. Art-only: `src/art.js`
  (+ regenerated `index.html` stamps); no engine, render, or data change, so the
  difficulty gate is byte-identical (blueplate survival@30 50.5%, seed 1/200).

### Added
- **Save & Continue — resume a run at its wave start, even after closing the tab**
  (Issue #83, Implementer hat). A run now checkpoints the START of the round you're
  in — never a mid-wave snapshot. The checkpoint (map, wave, Tips, Health, and each
  tower's type/position/committed path/tier/targeting) is written when you enter
  prep, after every prep change (build / upgrade / sell / targeting), and frozen
  the instant you call the wave — so a phone locked or a tab hard-closed **mid-wave**
  already has its wave-start save on disk (no unload-handler heroics). The hub shows
  a green **"Continue — Wave N"** (with the saved map's name) when a save exists;
  the pause menu gains **Resume** and **"Save & Quit — resumes at wave start"**;
  "Open for Service" starts fresh and says "(discards your saved run)". Restore
  rebuilds the board through the real build/upgrade code paths, so `spent` and every
  tier-2 signature flag reconstruct themselves, and parks prep past the early-call
  window so the bonus can't be earned twice for the same wave. Defeat clears the
  save; a version-mismatched or corrupt save is discarded silently. On iOS the
  `pagehide` / `visibilitychange` events auto-pause a backgrounded run. Purely
  additive to the engine and RNG-free: the difficulty gauge is byte-identical
  (blueplate survival@30 50.5%, seed 1/200) and the seeded smokes are unchanged.
  Covered by `tools/tests/save.test.mjs` (roundtrip + signature-flag rebuild +
  defeat-clears + version-mismatch discard).
- **Audio pass — bespoke sounds for every tower, upgrade signature, and economy
  action** (Issue #64, Implementer hat). 100% procedural Web Audio, no files, no
  deps. Each tower now sounds like what it *does*: The Regular's light fork tink
  (Fork Frenzy = rapid flurry, Carving Station = heavier shink); Big Appetite's
  one big **wet chomp** (retired the old inhale-gulp); The Photographer's camera
  **shutter + flash whine** (Long Exposure slow, Paparazzi a double-shutter
  burst); The Milkshake Slurper's actual **straw slurp** (Extra Slurp deeper,
  Silly Straw two gurgles); The Kids' Table's grabby-hand pats (Teenage Table
  lower/bored, Birthday Party a party-horn accent). New signature events: Speed
  Eater's crumb-scatter crunch and One Big Bite's comedic, distance-scaled
  **ptooey** spit. Economy feedback: place = a chair-scoot, sell = a cash-register
  cha-ching (was the build blip). Everything routes through a shared limiter and
  repeat-heavy events are throttled, so a full board can't clip or machine-gun.
  Audio uses a LOCAL rng (never the global) so the seeded smoke runs stay
  byte-identical. Audition the whole pass in the new
  `tools/dev/harness.html?mode=sounds` sound board. No engine mechanics changed;
  the difficulty gate is untouched (audio isn't loaded in the headless sim).

### Changed
- **Mobile-first UI restructure — landscape rail + slide-in upgrade sheet**
  (Issue #79). On a phone the whole 800×450 board scaled down, so upgrade
  buttons were tiny and hard to press. This pass moves the chrome **off** the
  board via a presentation-layer **viewport transform**: the design canvas grows
  to **900×450**, the tower deck becomes a **left rail** (cards stacked, pause +
  mute on top), the floating tower popover becomes a **right slide-in sheet**
  (portrait/name/committed-path header, a 2×2 targeting grid, two full-width
  path rows, Sell), the retired bottom toolbar frees an **apron** under the board
  for the tower blurb + the Send/Call-Wave button, and the hub gains **roomier,
  tappable customer cards** that expand a details view of each tower's two
  upgrade paths. The engine, maps, placement bounds, and sim are **untouched** —
  the board stays an 800×450 coordinate space offset right by the rail
  (`ctx.translate(BOARD.x, 0)`), and input maps the inverse; `data/balance.json`
  is unchanged, so the difficulty gauge can't move (`sim --check` byte-identical:
  blueplate survival@30 **50.5%**, seed 1/200). **Touch targets:** at
  iPhone-landscape scale (~844×390, canvas ~756 CSS px) **every** interactive
  rect measures **≥44 CSS px** in its smaller dimension (measured table in the
  PR). Also: `touch-action: none` on the canvas + `maximum-scale=1` +
  `overscroll-behavior: none` kill double-tap zoom and scroll-bounce. New chrome
  is named `COLOR` entries (`railBg`/`sheetBg`/`sheetScrim`); no mascot redraws,
  no new dependencies.
- **Tower evenness pass — path parity via delta magnitudes** (Issue #77, Stage 2).
  Two upgrade paths dominated their siblings on the survival gauge — **Fork Frenzy
  +43.5 pts** and **Paparazzi +29.5** — while the other eight already sat in a tight
  band. Four magnitude changes even all ten paths **without touching any signature's
  identity** (pierce stays 2 hits, double-freeze 2 targets, the 4th kid stays):
  Fork Frenzy's attack-speed `cooldownMul` 0.6→0.83 (that boost *was* the whole
  dominance — at 1.0 it's the weakest path); frost base `freezeDur` 1.0→0.91
  (shortens the freeze Paparazzi doubles) with Long Exposure's t1 `freezeDurAdd`
  0.2→0.29 exactly compensating so its total freeze — and the difficulty gate — is
  unchanged; and Speed Eater's `crumbDamage` 42→58 (its crumb splash was the weakest
  path even before). After: every tower's two paths within **≤3.6 pts**, all ten
  within a **5.4-pt spread** (500-sim). Gate held at **55.7%** (1000-sim); roles
  unchanged (the Photographer is still support — 0% solo by design). No engine
  change; no income reshaping needed. See the PR for the full before/after matrix.
- **Retire the Classic diner from the map picker** (Issue #77, Stage 1). The
  American Diner (`id: "diner"`) gets a `"retired": true` data flag: the hub map
  picker lists only non-retired maps, and with a single map left the picker row is
  **hidden entirely** (it returns automatically when Map 2 ships). A saved
  `META.mapId` pointing at the retired (or an unknown) map falls back to the
  default map safely. The diner's data **stays in `balance.json`** as the
  historical reference — the sims (`--map diner`), `--check` (prints it marked
  "retired, report only"), and maplint still exercise it. No `GAME_BRIEF` change.

### Added
- **Endless-only survival + Blue-Plate calibration** (Issue #75, Implementer hat).
  The finite 20-wave win is **gone**: every run is now endless and ends only in
  defeat, and your score is the wave you reach. The hub loses its finite/endless
  mode toggle (every run is endless); the in-run HUD wave counter drops the "/20"
  ceiling and reads "Wave N"; the run summary and hub surface **waves survived**
  and a new persisted **best-wave record** (`META.bestWave` — a record stat, the
  one sanctioned meta addition; older saves default it to 0 and stale toggle
  fields drop harmlessly). The difficulty gauge (`tools/sim.mjs`) is redefined for
  survival — "win" := reaching **wave 30** — and now reports survival@30 (the
  gate), P(reach 20/40), median waves survived, the died-at-wave spread, and
  wave-pacing stats (seconds/wave, run-to-30 time); its reference board fills all
  ten anchors so the survive-to-30 gate is reachable and economy/tier costs are
  real levers. Wave parity now covers waves 0..34, which surfaced and fixed a
  JS-vs-Python half-`.5` rounding divergence at wave 31 in the report-only Python
  model. Then a numbers-only balance pass calibrates **Blue-Plate** to the new
  survival gauge and makes it the gated map (`tuned:true`); the classic diner
  flips to `tuned:false` (report-only). See the tuning table in the PR for every
  changed number. No engine *mechanics* changed.
- **Blue-Plate Special — the new default map** (Issue #73, Implementer hat).
  The first content map on the maps[] platform (#70), built from the developer's
  ratified mockup (`docs/art-refs/blue-plate-special-1a.png`): a 50s-retro,
  3-lane out-and-back diner — dishes leave the kitchen top-left, run the full top
  lane, wrap down the right and back along the bottom, then the middle lane
  returns them to the **dish return** (the core) at the kitchen. It's now
  `maps[0]` (the fresh-META default); the existing **diner stays in the list,
  byte-for-byte unchanged** (SHA-256-proven identical frame) as the `tuned:true`
  reference that keeps the 58.0% CI gate alive. Blue-Plate ships `tuned:false`
  (report-only) — its reference build reads **59.0%**, a healthy baseline the
  upcoming retune PR calibrates and then gates. The map adds three **data-driven,
  default-OFF** theme capabilities (so every other map renders exactly as before):
  a `wallFrame` drawn in the bounds margin (costs no floor), belt direction
  `chevrons`, and `coreStyle:"dishReturn"` (kitchen-wall slot + placard vs the
  chute). New props (kitchen structure, register, counter+stools, prep) plus the
  shared jukebox/booths/dessert recolored via an optional `theme.props` palette
  that defaults to the diner's exact colors. The belt keeps a **dark surface**
  under silver rails so the foods still pop (verified mid-wave). Also: the
  authorized `GAME_BRIEF.md` core-line amendment (trash chute → dish return,
  per-map), and a cache-bust fix for the dev harness so a warm browser can't
  serve stale src during verification. No engine changes; no gameplay numbers
  changed outside the new map entry.

### Changed
- **UI & icon pass — chrome readability** (Issue #71, Implementer hat). A
  legibility + iconography pass on the game's chrome; **no gameplay or number
  changes** (the real-engine gate is byte-identical at 58.0% / median 20 /
  w20:84, and both smoke JSONs match main exactly — chrome reads game state,
  never writes it). What changed: the HUD gets proper **vector icons** (a
  rating-star placard for the Health Rating, a coin for Tips) instead of bare
  glyphs, on a rounded readout bar. Deck cards (toolbar **and** hub) share one
  card language — prominent portrait, legible name (hub cards wrap long names to
  two lines; "The " dropped so more reads), a **Tips-coin cost chip**, and three
  unmistakable states (selected with a color frame + accent bar, hover, and
  dimmed-with-red-cost when you can't afford it). The selected-tower panel adopts
  the same chip/button language (cost chips on the upgrade paths + a gold
  sell-refund chip; a vector padlock replaces the 🔒/✓ glyphs). Seated customers
  get a soft grounding shadow, a crisper selection ring, and a clearer hover
  range ring. **Palette discipline:** everything reuses the existing `COLOR`
  palette; the handful of genuinely shared chrome surfaces became **named
  `COLOR` entries** (`ctrlBg`/`ctrlSel`/`ctrlLine`/`ctrlLineHi`/`chip`/`hudBg`/
  `unitShadow`) so the coming diner remaster re-points chrome in one place — no
  new color direction, and `maps[].theme` (map surfaces) untouched. Icons are
  reusable `src/art.js` helpers (`drawRatingIcon`/`drawCurrencyIcon`/
  `drawLockIcon`/`drawSoftShadow`/`wrapLabel`), never assets or text glyphs.
  Hit-test geometry stays the single source of truth (`cardRect`/`towerPanel`
  unchanged, so `src/main.js` needed no edit); the toolbar strip stays at
  `TOOLBAR.y = 398`. Mascot identities were **not** redrawn.

### Added
- **Map platform — maps are now content** (Issue #69, Implementer hat). Turns
  "the map" into a `maps[]` list in `data/balance.json`: adding a map is one JSON
  block (path, placement rules, obstacles, sim anchors, and a `theme` block of
  surface colors/labels) plus a few prop drawers — no engine surgery. This PR
  ships the **platform with the existing diner as its only map, provably
  unchanged** (no second map, no visual redesign, no tuning — those are later
  PRs on top of this). New pieces: `engine.loadMap(id|object)` rebinds all
  per-map state (path/core/placement/obstacles/anchors/theme) and consumes no
  RNG; the renderer's floor/belt/kitchen/chute now read the active map's
  `theme`, so a reskin is literally JSON-only; a **hub map picker** (one entry
  today, remembered in `META`); `tools/sim.mjs --map <id>` with `--check` gating
  every `tuned:true` map; and **`tools/maplint.mjs`** (new CI step) which
  validates every map against the placement rules through the real `canPlace` —
  an unbuildable board or a prop overlapping a booth pad goes red instead of
  shipping. Pure plumbing: the real-engine gate is unchanged at 58.0% / median
  20 / w20:84 (200 sims, seed 1), and the smoke JSONs are byte-identical to
  before. Ships with `tools/tests/maps.test.mjs` (injects a fixture map, proves
  geometry rebinds both ways). No `src/audio.js`, no new `src/` files, no
  gameplay-number changes.
- **Sell towers for a partial refund** (Issue #66, Implementer hat). Every
  placed customer tracks what you've sunk into them (`spent`: base cost +
  purchased upgrade tiers); a new muted-red **Sell — refund ◆N** row at the
  bottom of the selected-tower panel pays back
  `floor(economy.sellRefund × spent)` — 70% to start, data-tunable in
  `data/balance.json` — removes the tower, and frees the floor for immediate
  rebuilding. Selling works whenever building does (prep AND mid-wave).
  Nothing in the engine holds a back-reference to a tower (projectiles track
  their target dish, enemy status effects are scalars, the Slurper's straws
  live on the tower itself), so removal is clean. The scripted sims never
  sell, and the `spent` field draws no RNG, so the real-engine gate is
  unchanged: 58.0% / median 20 / w20:84 (200 sims, seed 1). Ships with
  `tools/tests/sell.test.mjs` (config-derived, no tuned numbers). Sell sound
  folds into Issue #64 (no `src/audio.js` changes).

### Changed
- **Free tower placement + diner obstacles — the 10 fixed build slots are gone**
  (Issue #65, Implementer hat). Click anywhere valid on the diner floor to seat
  a customer: inside the playfield, off the conveyor belt (`pathBuffer`), not
  overlapping another tower (`towerSpacing`), and not inside a themed obstacle.
  All rules are data in `data/balance.json`'s new map schema (`placement` /
  `obstacles` / `simAnchors` replace `slots`). **No tower cap** — the economy is
  the limiter (developer decision; the sim spam-probe number in the PR measures
  it). Five diner props (mop bucket, jukebox, counter island, booth bank,
  dessert case) deny some of the strongest belt-hugging pockets; they block
  placement ONLY — no line-of-sight mechanic. The slot markers became a
  pointer-follow **placement ghost with a range preview ring** (green = legal +
  affordable, red = not), so you finally see range before buying; booth pads now
  appear under seated customers. The headless sims and harness build at
  `simAnchors` (the exact former slot coordinates), so the real-engine gate is
  UNCHANGED: 58.0% / median 20 / w20:84 at 200 sims, seed 1 — bit-identical to
  main. Ships with `tools/tests/placement.test.mjs` (config-derived probes, no
  tuned numbers). Docs-align: `GAME_BRIEF.md` map bullet + theme line (the two
  developer-authorized law edits), CLAUDE.md landmarks, balance `_note`,
  ART_STYLE decision log. Place/deny sounds fold into Issue #64 (no
  `src/audio.js` changes here).
- **The balance pass + the CI gauge switch (PR 5 — the final phase of the Issue
  #54 upgrade rework)** (Implementer hat). Numbers, costs, and CI policy only —
  no mechanic or test changes (the seven `tools/tests/*.test.mjs` pass UNEDITED;
  `src/engine.js`/`render.js`/`art.js`/`audio.js` untouched).
  - **The CI difficulty gate is now the REAL engine.** `node tools/sim.mjs
    --check` (runs `src/engine.js` headless — real projectile travel, straw-lock,
    knockback, double-freeze) replaces `tools/balance_sim.py --check` as the
    blocking band gate. **Honest framing:** the Python model was gauge-flattered —
    it has HP jitter and can't model the signatures, so it read ~53–58% while the
    real engine read ~20% at the rework's start and ~43% before this pass.
    `balance_sim.py` is demoted to a **report-only** second opinion (it now reads
    ~61%, above band — kept during the transition; the wave-parity gate still
    keeps it honest). Tooling: `sim.mjs` gained a `--paths tower=pathId` override
    and a died-at-wave line (for the path-value matrix).
  - **Tuned to the band against the real engine:** the reference board reads
    **56.7% / 58.7% / 55.0%** at seeds 1 / 1000 / 5000 (was 43%).
  - **Trap picks closed.** Before, 4 of 5 signature paths were severe traps (the
    1-D-ish real board rewards focused damage, so spread/AoE signatures lagged by
    15–69 points). Buffed their mechanics' tunables (pierce/crumb/silly-straw/
    4th-kid damage) so sibling paths now land within ~7 points — except **frost
    Paparazzi** (double-freeze), which stays ~10.6 points above Long Exposure;
    nerfing it would gut the signature, so it's flagged for the developer.
  - **Real per-tower/per-tier upgrade prices** (the flat 70/100 placeholders are
    gone; tier 2 costs more than tier 1; cheaper towers get cheaper upgrades).
  - **Known caveat for the playtest (documented, not a defect):** the real-engine
    sim uses one fixed reference build with no HP jitter, so at ~55% win the board
    fails at the peak wave — losses cluster at wave 20 rather than spreading over
    15–20. Genuine spread is a difficulty-curve *design* call (best made on feel);
    `waveGen` was deliberately left unchanged. Files: `data/balance.json`,
    `tools/sim.mjs`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `CLAUDE.md`, `SETUP-AND-LAUNCH.md`,
    `.claude/agents/designer.md` + `qa.md` (+ generated `balance.data.js` &
    `index.html`). **Awaiting the developer's playtest + a full Fable checkpoint
    before merge.**

### Added
- **The Kids' Table's tier-2 signatures — the 4th kid + the teen glow-up (PR 4,
  the last mechanic PR of the Issue #54 rework)** (Implementer hat).
  - **Birthday Party t2 — the 4th kid:** `maxTargets` goes 3 → 4 (a `maxTargetsAdd`
    delta). No new mechanic code — the existing multi branch already spreads the
    hands across the frontmost dishes, or piles all four onto one dish when it's
    alone. A fourth green-hatted kid joins the huddle in the art.
  - **Teenage Table t2 — pure damage + the big transformation:** the whole huddle
    grows into lanky teenagers — bigger kids, taller party hats, longer arms
    (`drawKid` gained a `teen` stretch param; `drawKidsTable` scales the huddle).
    Damage stays the tuned stat.
  - **Test + contact sheet:** `fourthhand.test.mjs` (4 in-range dishes all grabbed
    in one attack; a lone dish takes 4× the bite — relative to the tower's own
    damage, not a balance number; a base 3-kid table piles on only 3×). Contact
    sheet gains the Kids' Table path row.
  - **Verified:** balance gate **56.0%** (unchanged — zap isn't in the reference
    board and `teenageTable`'s deltas stay pure); all seven `tools/tests/*.test.mjs`
    green; wave-parity OK; real-engine `sim.mjs` 43.0% (report-only); both smoke
    JSONs (stat/signature) byte-identical to PR 3 (zap untouched in the reference
    build), both PASS with zero violations. Files: `data/balance.json`,
    `src/engine.js`, `src/art.js`, `tools/tests/fourthhand.test.mjs`,
    `tools/dev/harness.html`, `CLAUDE.md` (+ generated `balance.data.js` &
    `index.html` stamps). **PRs 1–4 complete — every tower has both signatures;
    PR 5 is the balance pass + gauge switch.**
- **The Photographer's and the Slurper's tier-2 signatures (PR 3 of the Issue #54
  rework)** (Implementer hat). Same path pattern as PRs 1–2.
  - **Long Exposure t2 — deepened after-slow:** the post-freeze slow becomes
    LONGER and STRONGER (`slowDurAdd`/`slowFactorAdd` — no new engine flag; it's
    the one signature the Python gauge models natively, so its numbers are tuned
    to hold the band).
  - **Paparazzi t2 — double-freeze:** one flash cycle freezes the frontmost TWO
    in-range dishes (a `freezeTargets` flag; the freeze branch mirrors the Kids'
    Table's multi-target spread). Both flashes apply the full freeze→slow.
  - **Silly Straw t2 — double drain:** the Slurper runs TWO straws at once, each
    latching its own dish and re-targeting independently when its dish dies or
    leaves range (the sniper's `slurpTarget` became a `slurpTargets` array;
    `drawSlurpStraws` loops it; one shared sip-sound throttle, not per-straw).
    Extra Slurp t2 stays pure damage.
  - **Art escalations + contact-sheet rows:** the Photographer's lens deepens on
    Long Exposure and gains flash bulbs on Paparazzi; the Slurper gets whipped
    cream (+ a cherry) on Extra Slurp and a second bendy straw on Silly Straw.
  - **Tests + the harness fix:** `tools/tests/_engine.mjs` `reset()` now sets
    lives/currency (at 0 lives `checkLoss()` froze update()-driven tests — a PR-2
    review footgun). New behavior tests `doublefreeze` / `extendedslow` (asserts
    the slow is longer + stronger RELATIVE to base, never absolute) / `doublestraw`.
  - **Verified:** balance gate **56.0%** (retuned the Long Exposure slow to hold
    the band, stable 56–57% across seeds); all six `tools/tests/*.test.mjs` green;
    wave-parity OK; real-engine `sim.mjs` **43.0%** (report-only, up as the
    reference frost's slow deepened); smoke seed 1 stat = clean win, signature =
    clean loss, both PASS with zero violations, same-seed byte-identical. Never
    touched `src/audio.js` (the sip throttle lives in the engine). Files:
    `data/balance.json`, `src/engine.js`, `src/render.js`, `src/art.js`,
    `tools/tests/*`, `tools/dev/harness.html` (+ generated `balance.data.js` &
    `index.html` stamps).
- **Big Appetite's two tier-2 signatures + a mechanic-test harness (PR 2 of the
  Issue #54 rework)** (Implementer hat). Extends PR 1's path pattern with the
  first two *signature* mechanics and the standing test machinery the PR-1 review
  asked for.
  - **Speed Eater t2 — crumb splash:** each cannon bite now also scatters
    damaging crumbs onto other dishes within a small radius of the bitten one
    (a real AoE — the base bite is still single-target). Tunables `crumbRadius`/
    `crumbDamage` in `data/balance.json`.
  - **One Big Bite t2 — knockback (the game's first backward path movement):** a
    dish that *survives* the bite is spit backward along the belt. Distance is
    **scaled by dish size** — a light fry sails, the Tough Steak barely budges
    (radius as the mass proxy, factor clamped 0.5×–2×) — clamps at the kitchen
    door (`dist ≥ 0`), and **dead dishes don't fly**. Tunables `knockbackBase`/
    `knockbackSizeRef`. Knocked-back dishes re-enter upstream ranges — intended.
  - **Big Appetite art escalations** (`src/art.js`): One Big Bite grows the maw
    each tier (a bigger bite); Speed Eater scatters more crumbs (a fast, messy
    eater). Contact sheet gains his path row.
  - **Mechanic behavior tests** (`tools/tests/*.test.mjs`, new CI step): headless
    tests that load the real engine and assert **behavior, not tuned numbers**
    (pierce skewers exactly 2 collinear dishes / off-ray takes 0; crumb hits
    inside the radius only; knockback pushes a survivor back, lighter flies
    farther, clamps at 0, dead dishes don't fly). This is now repo law — see
    CLAUDE.md's "definition of verified". The pierce test back-fills PR 1.
  - **Signature-paths smoke** (`?mode=smoke&paths=signature`): the scripted smoke
    player can now commit to the *signature* paths, so a full run exercises the
    tier-2 mechanics, not just stats. `SIM_PATHS` lookups in `tools/sim.mjs` +
    the harness are guarded against a missing/locked path (no crash).
  - **Numbers are placeholders** to keep the band gate green — cannon's gate path
    (`oneBigBite`) keeps its PR-1 damage, and the Python gauge ignores the
    signature flags, so `balance_sim.py --check` is unchanged at **54.5%**. Real
    tuning is PR 5. Docs followed the code: fixed the stale `CLAUDE.md`
    `tryUpgrade`/`up` landmark and `docs/ART_STYLE.md`'s course-name references;
    added a grep-`*.md` step to `implementer.md`.
  - **Verified:** balance gate 54.5% (unchanged); `tools/tests/*.test.mjs` green;
    wave-parity OK; real-engine `sim.mjs` **41.0%** (report-only, up from 36% now
    that knockback is live); smoke seed 1 stat = clean loss, signature = clean
    loss, both PASS with zero violations and same-seed byte-identical. Files:
    `data/balance.json`, `src/engine.js`, `src/art.js`, `tools/tests/*`,
    `tools/dev/harness.html`, `tools/sim.mjs`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`,
    `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/ART_STYLE.md`, `.claude/agents/implementer.md`
    (+ generated `balance.data.js` & `index.html` stamps).

### Fixed
- **Blocky canvas scaling on Retina/iPhone screens.** `style.css` forced
  `image-rendering: pixelated` on the game canvas ("crisp edges when we draw
  pixel art later") — but the art became smooth vector-style canvas drawing,
  not pixel art, so on any screen where the 800×450 canvas is scaled
  (devicePixelRatio 2–3 on Mac Retina and every iPhone) all the mascots,
  outlines, and canvas text rendered visibly jagged with nearest-neighbor
  sampling. Removed the override so the browser's default smooth scaling
  applies; canvas text now matches the page's HTML text in sharpness.
  No gameplay/balance change. File: `style.css`.

### Added
- **Pause (strategic pause)** (Developer hat; the review's last item-10 piece).
  A pause/resume button beside mute (shown during a run) plus **P / Space**;
  a phone call mid-wave no longer costs the run. Implemented entirely in the
  SHELL: the loop stops calling `update()` and drops banked time (nothing
  fast-forwards on resume); the engine never knows, so the headless sim and
  the seeded smoke runs are untouched — **seed 1 re-verified bit-identical**.
  While paused the board dims under a PAUSED label but the toolbar/panel stay
  live — you can still seat and upgrade (classic TD strategic pause). The
  early-call bonus correctly freezes with prep time. Auto-unpauses outside a
  run so a new run never starts frozen; keyboard handler ignores form fields
  (the dev harness has inputs). Also swept the last flagged dead code: the
  unreachable sniper projectile-speed ternary in `fireProjectile` (sniper
  returns before the projectile push) is now a plain `360`.
  Files: `src/main.js`, `src/render.js`, `src/engine.js` (+ stamps).

### Changed
- **Tower upgrades: three courses → two exclusive paths (PR 1 of the Issue #54
  rework)** (Implementer hat). Each customer no longer walks a single
  Appetizer→Entrée→Dessert ladder. Instead every tower now offers **two named
  upgrade paths, each two tiers deep** — tier 1 a stat buff, tier 2 a signature
  change to how it attacks. **Buying tier 1 of one path permanently locks the
  other** for that placed customer (a real build choice), and the tower panel
  now shows two path buttons: after you commit, the other greys out to
  "🔒 locked" and the chosen path reveals its tier-2 cost. Course names
  (Appetizer/Entrée/Dessert) are gone everywhere.
  - **All ten tier-1 stat upgrades are live**; the two tier-2 *signatures* built
    in this PR are **The Regular's**, as the vertical slice: **Fork Frenzy** t2
    turns the thrown fork into a straight-line projectile that pierces the first
    dish and skewers a second (the base Regular keeps today's homing fork), and
    **Carving Station** t2 is pure damage with an art escalation — the fork grows
    bigger at tier 1 and becomes a large two-tine metal serving fork at tier 2
    (`src/art.js`). The other towers' signatures (crumb splash, knockback,
    double-freeze, double-straw, 4th kid) are stubbed as placeholder stats and
    land in PRs 2–4.
  - **Data model:** each tower's `up` block and `economy.upgradeCost` in
    `data/balance.json` are replaced by an `upgrades` schema (2 paths × 2 tiers
    `{ cost, ...deltas }`). **These numbers are placeholders tuned only to keep
    the balance gate in band** — the real per-tower/per-upgrade tuning is the
    balance pass (PR 5), which runs against the real-engine sim. The engine stays
    DOM/canvas/audio-free; both headless sims (`tools/balance_sim.py`,
    `tools/sim.mjs`) and the harness smoke run were updated to pick one fixed
    path per tower and apply tier deltas, so the Python band gate stays green.
  - **Verified:** `balance_sim.py --check` **54.5%** (band 50–60%, stable 53–56%
    across seeds 1–5); wave-parity OK; real-engine `sim.mjs` **36.0%**
    (report-only); seeded smoke seed 1 = clean loss, seed 7 = clean win, both
    PASS with zero violations, same-seed byte-identical. Files:
    `data/balance.json`, `src/engine.js`, `src/render.js`, `src/main.js`,
    `src/data.js`, `src/art.js`, `tools/balance_sim.py`, `tools/sim.mjs`,
    `tools/dev/harness.html` (+ generated `balance.data.js` & `index.html` stamps).
- **Slack heartbeat: hourly → daily** (QA hat). The studio-feed cron posted
  "cloud automation is alive" every hour, 24/7 — ~720 no-op messages a month
  drowning the signal (every real push already announces itself). Now one
  heartbeat a day at 13:00 UTC. File: `.github/workflows/studio-feed.yml`.
- **Branching flow simplified: no more chaining; repo hardened** (QA hat;
  developer-approved 2026-07-04). The stacked-PR footgun that stranded PR #44
  (it merged into its parent feature branch instead of `main`) came from
  written policy — `AUTONOMY.md` told overnight workers to chain branches.
  Changed: **every branch cuts from up-to-date `origin/main`; every PR targets
  `--base main` explicitly; unattended runs cap at 2 open PRs then stop**
  (`AUTONOMY.md` rewritten, `implementer.md` step 2 updated). Repo settings set
  the same day (via `gh api`, developer-approved): **auto-delete merged PR
  branches** and **branch protection on `main`** requiring the CI `checks` job
  (no required reviews — solo repo; admin can bypass). Hygiene: 21 fully-merged
  remote branches and 5 local ones deleted (every tip verified an ancestor of
  `main` first — zero content loss). Files: `AUTONOMY.md`,
  `.claude/agents/implementer.md`.
- **`main.js` split into six `src/` modules + a real-engine headless sim**
  (Developer hat; developer-approved 2026-07-04; the review's items 8 & 9).
  - **The split** (`src/data.js` → `engine.js` → `audio.js` → `art.js` →
    `render.js` → `main.js`, ordered script tags, plain globals, no bundler —
    double-click still works): `engine.js` holds ALL game logic and is
    **DOM/canvas/audio-free**; its side effects (sounds, the call-early popup)
    go through no-op `FX` hooks that `src/main.js` wires to the real audio/UI.
    Art PRs and engine PRs no longer touch the same file.
  - **Proof it changed nothing:** the split was done by a mechanical,
    assert-guarded partition of `main.js` (reassembles byte-exact; exactly 18
    audio→FX call rewrites), and the seeded harness smoke runs are
    **bit-identical before/after** (seed 1: loss at wave 20, 211 eaten, 31,461
    steps; seed 2: win, 217 eaten, 31,511 steps — every field equal). Game
    loads with zero console errors; contact sheet renders; Python sim gate
    still 53.0% BALANCED.
  - **`tools/sim.mjs` — the real-engine sim:** plays whole seeded games through
    the actual `src/engine.js` in Node (no mirror). 200 games in ~4s (the
    Python model needs ~3 min). **Finding: the real engine reads ~20.5%
    win-rate for the steady reference vs the Python gauge's 53.0%** — the
    instant-hit/no-overkill/HP-jitter simplifications flatter the player; real
    runs reach wave 20 at median and mostly die there. Reported, not retuned —
    which gauge difficulty targets is the developer's call. CI now prints the
    real-engine number on every PR (report-only; Python stays the gate).
  - **`tools/check_parity.py` — a new CI GATE:** the game's `makeWave(0..24)`
    (dumped by sim.mjs) must match the Python sim's `make_wave` exactly, so
    silent formula drift (e.g. JS `Math.round(2.5)=3` vs Python banker's
    `round(2.5)=2`) turns into a red run. Currently: all 25 waves identical.
  - Tooling/docs updated: `gen_balance.py` stamps all six modules;
    CI syntax-checks them; the harness loads them; `CLAUDE.md` map + landmarks
    re-pathed per module; `AGENTS.md`/`implementer.md` scope rules updated
    (logic only in the DOM-free engine). Files: `src/*` (new), `main.js`
    (deleted), `index.html`, `tools/sim.mjs` + `tools/check_parity.py` (new),
    `tools/gen_balance.py`, `tools/balance_sim.py` (comments),
    `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `tools/dev/harness.html`, docs.
- **Backbone aligned to faceless foods + dead googly-eyes code removed**
  (Developer hat; developer-confirmed 2026-07-04). `docs/FRANCHISE_BACKBONE.md`'s
  tone rules still described food with "googly eyes" — superseded by the art
  deep-dive (PR #43), which made every dish **faceless and food-forward**, with
  panic read through tiny legs, speed lines, and scattering. The tone rule now
  states the faceless-by-design decision (customers keep their faces) and
  points to `docs/ART_STYLE.md`. Also removed `drawGooglyEyes()` from
  `main.js` — unused since the deep-dive (zero call sites), kept only by
  accident; deleted so it can't drift back in. Ran `gen_balance.py`
  (`index.html` cache-bust re-stamped). **No gameplay, balance, or visual
  change** — verified: game loads with zero console errors.
  Files: `docs/FRANCHISE_BACKBONE.md`, `main.js` (+ `index.html` stamp).
- **Docs/comment alignment + a balance ease** (Developer hat). Post-rework cleanup
  so nothing reads as outdated: `docs/FRANCHISE_BACKBONE.md` cast roles +
  personalities rewritten to the new combat identities (Big Appetite = heavy
  single bite, Photographer = freeze→slow, Milkshake Slurper = fast drain, Kids'
  Table = multi-target); `GAME_BRIEF.md` behavior examples updated; stale `main.js`
  comments fixed (Big Appetite plate/single-bite, Slurper fast-drain, the audio
  `sniper` case renamed off "Chopstick Sensei"); a pointer note added to the
  historical `deckbound-retheme-prompt.md` naming map. Balance ease: Big Appetite
  cooldown **3.0 → 2.8s** — reference build **53.0% (BALANCED)**. (Flagged for the
  audio branch: some attack *sounds* no longer match the reworked attacks.)
- **Docs consolidated: one repo map, stale facts fixed, history archived**
  (docs task; developer-approved 2026-07-04). The repo map was written in five
  places and two copies had drifted (AGENTS.md said `main.js` was "~950 lines"
  — it's ~2,000; README said "10 waves" — it's 20, generated). Now:
  - **`CLAUDE.md` holds THE map** ("Where things live") plus a new **code
    landmarks** index for `main.js` (function → purpose, so agents stop
    re-scanning a 2,000-line file); `AGENTS.md`'s map section is a pointer,
    and its fossilized v1-backlog snapshot is replaced by "read Issues live."
  - **`README.md` status** updated to the shipped post-v1 reality.
  - **`docs/archive/`** created (with an index README): `FIRST-NIGHT.md`,
    `SETUP-RUNBOOK.md`, `deckbound-retheme-prompt.md`, and
    `design-bigger-map-endless.md` moved in — superseded records, kept but
    clearly out of the way; inbound links fixed.
  - **The untracked `UPGRADES-HANDOFF.md` became pinned Issue #54** (the
    tower-upgrades rework plan of record) — it was the next feature's entire
    design state sitting uncommitted on one machine; now it's versioned and
    visible to every agent. The file is deleted.
  Files: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `docs/FRANCHISE_BACKBONE.md`
  (link), `docs/archive/*`.
- **Target win-rate band tightened: 45–60% → 50–60%** (developer decision,
  2026-07-04). Balance changes now aim for a coin-flip-or-better reference
  game: `data/balance.json` `target_win_rate` is `[0.50, 0.60]`. The band
  lives in the JSON, so the sim, the CI gate, and the printed verdicts all
  pick it up automatically; the sim's code fallback and the SETUP-AND-LAUNCH
  doc were updated to match. Current reference build reads **53.0% —
  BALANCED inside the new band** (`--check --sims 200`, exit 0), so nothing
  needs retuning today; the floor just rose from 45% to 50% for all future
  tuning. Historical 45–60% mentions in CHANGELOG entries and archived design
  docs are left as history. Files: `data/balance.json`, `balance.data.js`
  (generated), `index.html` (stamp), `tools/balance_sim.py`,
  `SETUP-AND-LAUNCH.md`.
- **Combat feel tweaks** (Developer hat, follow-up to the rework):
  - **Milkshake Slurper** — the straw now **stays attached** to one dish and sips
    fast until it dies or leaves range (was rapid-firing separate straws); sip
    sound throttled. Sniper fires instantly now (no traveling projectile).
  - **Big Appetite** — **lunges ~2× farther** and the CHOMP is punchier (bite
    flash + chunkier crumbs). **More damage, slower reload** (72→90 dmg,
    2.4→3.0s); reference re-checked at **46.5% (BALANCED)**.
  - **Kids' Table** — the grab hands now have **little arms** (sleeve + forearm)
    so they read as kids reaching in.
- **Combat rework: five distinct attack identities + new mechanics** (Developer
  hat). Builds on the art deep-dive branch. Each customer now fights differently,
  with the mechanics mirrored in `tools/balance_sim.py` so the sim stays honest:
  - **The Regular** (`arrow`) — throws forks; mid damage, medium speed (unchanged
    numbers, now a themed fork projectile).
  - **Big Appetite** (`cannon`) — **single-target** now (was splash): lunges in and
    his **mouth chomps** the dish right on the belt (instant, big damage 90→72,
    slow 2.4s reload, short range). Reusable tower-lunge added.
  - **The Photographer** (`frost`) — new **freeze** mechanic: a flash makes the dish
    **pose (freeze) 1s**, then it's **slowed 3s** (0.62×); very low damage. Camera
    viewfinder-frame visual, no ice.
  - **The Milkshake Slurper** (`sniper`) — tiny damage, **very fast** (~7 sips/sec),
    small-med range: you watch a dish's HP drain up the straw.
  - **The Kids' Table** (`zap`) — new **multi-target**: 3 hands grab up to 3 dishes;
    if only one is in range all three pile onto it (3× damage). Instant hand-grab
    visual.
  - **Progressive food bites:** dishes show a bite eaten out past 3/4 HP that grows
    past 1/2 HP; the Fry Swarm loses fries (5→3→1). Reads a dish's health at a glance.
  - **Balance:** `balance_sim.py` extended for freeze + multi + single-target; a
    tuning pass lands the reference build at **50.7% (BALANCED)** while keeping the
    Photographer's 1s/3s feel. `audio` object untouched.
- **Art deep-dive: all 5 customers + 4 foods redrawn** (Developer hat). Every
  tower is now a fully-drawn seated-diner mascot with its own body and props
  (still canvas-only, signature color kept as the at-a-glance ID), and every
  enemy is a food-forward, faceless dish designed to read on the belt at ~15px:
  - **Customers** (`drawCustomer`, now dispatched to a per-id mascot; the shared
    legacy glyph is gone): **The Regular** (raised fork), **Big Appetite** (round
    glutton holding a plate), **The Photographer** (beret + camera, flash on
    fire), **The Milkshake Slurper** (soda-jerk sipping a shake — renamed from
    Chopstick Sensei; the long slurp-straw is reserved for the attack pass), and
    **The Kids' Table** (a huddle of party-hat kids).
  - **Foods** (`drawFood`): **Hot Dog** (renamed from Chicken Nugget), **Slider**,
    **Tough Steak**, **Fry Swarm** — silhouette-first, sized by HP, with grounding
    shadows; distinct in both shape and color.
  - Two **display-name** changes only (sniper → *The Milkshake Slurper*, mote →
    *Hot Dog*) in `data/balance.json` + `docs/FRANCHISE_BACKBONE.md`; ran
    `gen_balance.py`. **No IDs, balance numbers, gameplay, map, or the `audio`
    object touched.** `balance_sim.py`: reference **55.5% (BALANCED)**, unchanged.
- **Audio warmth pass** (Developer hat). Feedback was that "pretty much every
  sound kind of has a robotic sound to it" — the Phase 4 audio reskin got the
  *themes* right but the raw oscillators/white-noise still sounded synthetic.
  Same 100% procedural Web Audio, no files, no libraries — just better synthesis:
  - New shared helpers in the `audio` object: `env()` (soft-attack, click-free
    exponential-release gain envelope — the #1 fix for "robotic," since hard
    gain jumps/stops are what read as digital clicks) and `voice()` (2–3
    slightly detuned oscillators layered through a lowpass filter, with
    optional vibrato/pitch drift and a filter-cutoff sweep). `tone()` now
    delegates to `voice()` so every caller gets the envelope for free.
  - `noiseBurst()` now runs white noise through a bandpass/lowpass filter
    (instead of raw broadband noise) for organic chomp/crunch/clatter
    transients instead of "static."
  - Every effect rebuilt on these helpers: attacks (bite/chomp per customer —
    cannon=deep gulp, frost=shutter-click nibble, sniper=crisp pluck,
    zap=tiny nibble, default=fork-stab), kill (crunch + gulp), leak (clatter +
    descending "trombone," now with a touch of vibrato), upgrade ("order up!"
    bell), hit (light fork tink), build/deny/waveStart/buy/win/lose. Same
    per-type distinction and pitch randomization as before — only the timbre
    changed.
  - **No gameplay/balance change** — sim still reads **55.5% (BALANCED)**. Mute
    toggle and first-tap unlock behave exactly as before (verified: zero
    oscillators created while muted; no throw when not yet unlocked).
  - Verified structurally in a browser: no JS console errors, AudioContext
    reaches `"running"` after unlock, and every `audio.*` effect method runs
    without throwing. Actual sound quality still needs on-device confirmation
    from the developer — the preview tooling can't play audio. Files:
    `main.js` (+ `index.html` cache-bust).

### Added
- **Dev harness — self-serve verification for agents** (QA hat). New
  `tools/dev/harness.html` loads the REAL game code (no copies, no mocks) and
  formalizes the scratch-dir `gallery.html` trick as a committed tool:
  - **Contact sheet:** every customer at levels 1/2/3 (+ attack fx poses +
    toolbar size) and every food at fresh/¾HP/½HP/hurt/true belt size, drawn by
    the real `drawCustomer()`/`drawFood()` onto one canvas — art PRs attach ONE
    screenshot of this instead of per-asset back-and-forth.
  - **Smoke run:** a scripted full run through the real `update()` loop with a
    **seeded RNG** (same seed → identical run; a repro is a URL), invariant
    checks (currency ≥ 0, lives in range, finite enemy state, legal phases),
    and a JSON verdict. Verified: seed 1 = PASS (clean loss at wave 20, 31,461
    steps, ~110 ms), byte-identical across reloads; seed 2 = PASS (win) — the
    ~53% config genuinely bracketed.
  - **Play driver:** the real game with live input plus a speed multiplier
    (1–8×) and exact frame-stepping (the harness freezes the game's own rAF
    loop at boot and drives `update()`/`render()` itself).
  - URL params for automation: `?mode=sheet|smoke|play&seed=N&build=ids&speed=N`.
  - `CLAUDE.md`'s Verification section is now a **definition of verified**:
    sim number quoted, smoke JSON pasted, contact-sheet screenshot attached —
    agents verify before requesting review, not the developer after.
  No gameplay/balance change — `main.js` untouched. Files:
  `tools/dev/harness.html`, `CLAUDE.md`.
- **First real CI checks** (QA hat). A new `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on
  every PR and push to `main` — until now the only workflow was the Slack
  announcer, so "let Actions run its checks" checked nothing. Three gates, all
  deterministic:
  1. **JS syntax** — `node --check` on `main.js` + `balance.data.js` (no build
     step exists to catch a broken script before it ships).
  2. **Generated files in sync** — re-runs `tools/gen_balance.py` and fails if
     the committed `balance.data.js` or `index.html` cache-bust stamps are
     stale (i.e. someone edited `data/balance.json` or `main.js` and forgot
     the generator).
  3. **Balance band** — `tools/balance_sim.py --check` (new flag): plays the
     reference board with a fixed seed and **exits non-zero if its win-rate
     leaves the target band**, so a difficulty-breaking PR goes red instead of
     relying on someone reading the printout. Verified locally: current config
     reads **53.0% (BALANCED, exit 0)** at `--sims 200`; an impossible band
     correctly fails (exit 1). No gameplay/balance change.
  Files: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `tools/balance_sim.py`.
- **Art style guide + reference drop-box** (Game Designer hat; docs-only, no
  code). The project's visual taste was scattered across CHANGELOG prose, code
  comments, and chat history — so every art pass re-derived it and every
  review re-litigated it. Now written down:
  - `docs/ART_STYLE.md` — hard rules (original-only, canvas-vector-only,
    comedic never gross), the identity system (signature color = the ID, one
    identity feature each, silhouette-first, size = HP, **foods are
    faceless**), technique (shared helpers, r-relative coords, MDARK outline),
    state language (one growing bite, snapshot-freeze **no ice**, bib/sparkle
    upgrades), the readability bar, a **pre-PR checklist** agents run alone,
    and an append-only **Decision Log** seeded with every settled call so
    none get re-argued.
  - `docs/art-refs/` — the developer's visual reference drop-box (mood refs,
    marked-up feedback, approved contact sheets as the comparison baseline);
    agents must check it before any art task.
  - The flagged `FRANCHISE_BACKBONE.md` "googly eyes" contradiction was
    confirmed by the developer (2026-07-04): the backbone alignment + dead
    `drawGooglyEyes()` removal landed as their own PR #51.
  Files: `docs/ART_STYLE.md`, `docs/art-refs/README.md`.
- **Re-theme, Phase 5 — file follow-up design** (Game Designer hat; file-only, no
  build). Closes out the retheme by recording future work: filed **Issue #39 —
  "Map 2: the Pizzeria + Pizza Supreme (splitter enemy)"** (the franchise's first
  new mechanic — spawn-on-death, needs an engine + sim + balance pass), and parked
  three later restaurant concepts (seafood shack / drive-thru / buffet) in
  `docs/ideas-parked.md`. No gameplay change. (The optional internal-ID→themed-name
  migration was deferred.) File: `docs/ideas-parked.md`.
- **Re-theme, Phase 4 — audio reskin** (Developer hat; Issue #37). The procedural
  Web Audio (generated in code, no files, no deps) now sounds like the diner.
  **No gameplay/balance change** — the sim still reads **55.5% (BALANCED)**.
  - **Attacks are bites/chomps**, one flavor per customer (per-type distinction +
    ±7% pitch randomization kept): deep inhaling gulp (Big Appetite), shutter-click
    nibble (The Photographer), crisp pluck (Chopstick Sensei), tiny fast nibble
    (The Kids' Table), steady fork-stab (The Regular).
  - **Kill = a satisfying crunch + gulp** (swallow-down sweep + a low tail).
  - **Leak = a clatter + a sad descending 'trombone' blip** — a new `audio.leak()`
    fired when a dish reaches the trash chute (the flash + shake already there).
  - **Upgrade = an "order up!" service-bell ding-ding** (bell-like).
  - Non-lethal hit = a light fork *tink*. The **mute toggle + first-tap unlock are
    unchanged**.
  - Verified in a browser: no JS errors; the AudioContext runs and every sound
    generates without throwing; `audio.leak()` fires exactly once on a real leak
    (lives decrement correctly). Actual sound to be confirmed on-device (the
    preview can't capture audio). Files: `main.js` (+ `index.html` cache-bust).
- **Re-theme, Phase 3 — Map 1: the conveyor belt** (Developer hat; Issue #35).
  Map 1 now reads as an American diner: food leaves the **kitchen** (spawn), rides
  a **conveyor belt** past the tables, and any dish reaching the **trash chute** is
  wasted. **No gameplay/balance change** — the map geometry (`map.path`/`map.slots`)
  is unchanged, so the sim still reads **55.5% (BALANCED)**; this is all rendering.
  - **Belt** (`drawPath`): metal rails + a belt surface with **slats that animate
    toward the chute** (offset driven by `game.elapsed`, so the fixed-timestep loop
    conveys it for free).
  - **Kitchen door** (`drawKitchenDoor`) at the spawn — swinging half-doors + a
    "KITCHEN" sign; dishes emerge from its dark mouth. (Trash chute was already
    themed in Phase 2.)
  - **Diner background** (`drawBackground`): a low-contrast checkerboard floor +
    booth/table pads under the seats — kept subtle so the belt, customers, and food
    stay the things that pop. Verified at desktop + iPhone (375px).
  - **Why the geometry is untouched:** the existing serpentine already reads as a
    winding conveyor line (kitchen at the left entry, chute at the right end), and
    keeping it guarantees the balance the sim locked at 55.5% — which the spec
    prioritizes ("keep total path length + slot count so balance holds"). A future
    map redesign can be its own issue.
  - Removed the now-dead path-color constants. Files: `main.js` (+ `index.html`
    cache-bust).
- **Re-theme, Phase 2 — art reskin** (Developer hat; Issue #33). All-new
  canvas art for the restaurant theme — original, cheap shapes, one readable
  identity feature each. **No gameplay, no balance numbers, no internal IDs, no
  dependencies**; the reference board still reads **55.5% (BALANCED)** (the sim
  reads only `data/balance.json`, which is untouched).
  - **Enemies are now food** (`drawFood`): Chicken Nugget (golden blob, googly
    eyes, legs), The Slider (bun/patty/bun burger with motion lines), Tough Steak
    (dark slab, grill marks, thick outline — reads as the big one), Fry Swarm (a
    scatter of yellow sticks). Enemy colors are now food colors; **radii are kept**
    because they already echo real HP (steak > nugget > slider > fries).
  - **Towers are now seated customers** (`drawCustomer`): The Regular (raised
    fork), Big Appetite (open mouth), The Photographer (camera + a flash burst
    when firing), Chopstick Sensei (glasses + chopsticks), The Kids' Table (party
    hat). Upgrades add a napkin/bib (Entrée) and a chef's-kiss sparkle (Dessert),
    reusing the existing grow/glow/pips.
  - **Core → trash chute/bin** (lid, ridges, "TRASH"); the leak flash + screen
    shake are kept.
  - **HUD icons:** lives → a star-rating glyph; currency → a tip coin ($).
  - **Kill juice → CHOMP:** a bite-flash pop + scattering crumbs; the kill popup
    is now "+$N tip". The non-lethal white spark (fork tink) is kept.
  - Removed the now-unused geometric `drawTowerShape`/`drawTowerDetail` and the
    dead `shape` field. Verified all 5 customers + 4 foods read distinctly at
    desktop and iPhone (375px) size. Files: `main.js` (+ `index.html` cache-bust).
- **Re-theme, Phase 1 — text & label reskin** (Developer hat; Issue #31). Every
  player-facing string now reads as the restaurant theme; **no gameplay, no
  balance numbers, no internal IDs changed** — the reference board still reads
  **55.5% (BALANCED)** in `tools/balance_sim.py`, and a pre-change localStorage
  save still loads.
  - **Display names are now data-driven.** Tower `name`/`blurb` and enemy `name`
    moved out of `main.js`'s art objects into `data/balance.json` (read via the
    generated `balance.data.js`), so future reskins are a JSON edit. IDs
    (`arrow`/`mote`/…) are unchanged; only added string fields.
  - **Customers (towers):** The Regular, Big Appetite, The Photographer, Chopstick
    Sensei, The Kids' Table. **Runaway food (enemies):** Chicken Nugget, The
    Slider, Tough Steak, Fry Swarm.
  - **UI strings:** Golden Forks (was Essence), Tips (currency), Health (lives),
    the TRASH chute (core), upgrade levels shown as **Appetizer → Entrée →
    Dessert**, "Open for Service", "Send Wave", "Full menu / All-you-can-eat"
    modes, hub/shop labels (Reserve Chopstick Sensei's seat, Cash float, Forgiving
    inspector), and end screens ("Service complete" / "Shut down by the health
    inspector"). `index.html` tagline/footer/aria-label themed too.
  - **Kept "Wave"** (not "Course") for the wave counter, because "Course" now
    collides with the Appetizer/Entrée/Dessert upgrade levels.
  - **Known cosmetic follow-up for Phase 2 (art):** the longer names are tight in
    the small deck/toolbar cards (shrunk to 9px as a stopgap); Phase 2 redraws
    those cards and will fit them cleanly.
  - Files: `data/balance.json`, `main.js`, `index.html`, `balance.data.js`
    (generated).
- **Re-theme, Phase 0 — docs only** (Game Designer hat; Issue #29). Starts
  re-skinning the game from the arcane-wardens / Wellspring / Blight placeholder
  to **hungry restaurant customers vs. runaway food** (the towers are seated diner
  customers; the enemies are dishes escaping down a conveyor belt to the trash
  chute). This phase changes **documentation only** — no gameplay, no balance
  numbers, and no internal IDs (`arrow`/`mote`/etc.) change; the reference board
  still reads 55.5% (BALANCED) in `tools/balance_sim.py`. Changes:
  - New `deckbound-retheme-prompt.md` at the repo root — the authoritative
    retheme spec (naming map, hard invariants, phased plan).
  - Rewrote the **Theme** section of `GAME_BRIEF.md` (that section only, which the
    brief marks as swappable) to the restaurant theme.
  - New `docs/FRANCHISE_BACKBONE.md` — core relationship, through-line, cast table
    (5 towers + 4 enemies with personalities), threat definition, core verb
    (**CHOMP**), and tone rules.
  - Updated `README.md`'s one-liner to mention the theme.
  - **Developer deviation from the spec:** the spec said to *park* the old theme
    in `docs/ideas-parked.md` ("parked, not deleted"); per developer direction the
    old theme was **removed** instead, so it is dropped rather than parked.
  Files: `deckbound-retheme-prompt.md`, `GAME_BRIEF.md`, `docs/FRANCHISE_BACKBONE.md`,
  `README.md`.
- **Larger map, generated waves, and endless groundwork** (developer-approved
  post-v1 addition, beyond the frozen v1 scope).
  - **Bigger map**: a longer, more-winding single map — a six-lane serpentine
    (~2300 px vs ~1350) with 10 tower slots — all in `data/balance.json` (`map`),
    so the game and sim both use it. Still one 16:9 map (multi-map stays parked).
  - **Wave generation**: the fixed 10-wave table is replaced by a `waveGen`
    formula block; `makeWave(n)` (mirrored in `tools/balance_sim.py`) produces
    wave n's hp/speed/interval/composition from base parameters. Finite play now
    runs 20 formula-scaled rounds and still ends in a win. Re-tuned so the sim's
    reference strategy reads ~55.5% — inside the 45–60% band (`hpGrowth` 1.134,
    `countStep` 0.6).
  - **Endless groundwork** (off by default): a finite/endless hub toggle, a wave
    counter, and a score. Endless keeps generating waves until you lose
    (survival + score) — verified by the sim's median-waves-survived metric, not
    win-rate. **Default is finite with the win condition intact; whether to
    offer/keep endless is flagged for the developer (it removes the win.)**
  - Files: `data/balance.json`, `main.js`, `index.html`, `balance.data.js`
    (generated), `tools/balance_sim.py`, `docs/design-bigger-map-endless.md`.
- **Per-tower targeting priority** (developer-approved post-v1 addition). Each
  placed tower now has a targeting mode — **First** (furthest along the path,
  default), **Last**, **Strong** (most HP), **Close** (nearest to the tower).
  Click a placed tower to open a panel with the four modes plus its upgrade
  button; the choice is per-tower and can be changed live during a wave, visibly
  changing which enemy the tower fires at. Default First matches the balance
  sim's frontmost targeting, so no balance change and no sim change. Files:
  `main.js`.
- **Call the wave early for a bonus** (developer-approved post-v1 addition). The
  Start Wave button now shows a currency bonus (e.g. `+18`) that's full the
  instant a prep phase begins and decays linearly to 0 over
  `economy.earlyCallWindow` seconds. Calling the wave grants the current bonus —
  rewarding aggressive play without adding a forced countdown (prep stays
  no-clock; you're never made to start). Bonus size/window are tunable in
  `data/balance.json` (`economy.earlyCallBonus`, `economy.earlyCallWindow`).
  Balance: the sim's steady reference doesn't call early, so the band gauge is
  unchanged (59.5%, BALANCED); the sim reports a "call early" upper bound (88%)
  as the free-income worst case (real aggressive play pays a prep-time cost the
  sim can't model). Files: `data/balance.json`, `main.js`, `tools/balance_sim.py`.

### Changed
- **Cache-busting on deploy.** `tools/gen_balance.py` now also stamps a short
  content-hash version onto `index.html`'s script tags (`main.js?v=…`,
  `balance.data.js?v=…`). GitHub Pages serves assets with a fixed ~10-minute
  cache and no header override, so without this a browser could keep running an
  old `main.js` (or mix a new page with a stale script) after a deploy. The hash
  changes only when a file's contents change — no manual version bumping. (The
  query is ignored by the `file://` resolver, so double-click play is unaffected.)
- **The map is now data-driven.** The path and tower slots moved out of hardcoded
  arrays in `main.js` into `data/balance.json` (`map.path`, `map.slots`,
  `map.coreRadius`). The game builds `PATH`/`SLOTS`/`CORE` from that data, so a
  map can be redesigned by editing JSON — no code change. `tools/balance_sim.py`
  now reads the same map and simulates combat on the real path (enemies march by
  arc-length; towers fire from real 2-D slot positions using 2-D range), so its
  win-rate tracks whatever map you build. The shipped map is unchanged and still
  reads BALANCED (~60%). Only pure art (colors/shapes) remains in `main.js`.
  Files: `data/balance.json`, `main.js`, `balance.data.js` (generated),
  `tools/balance_sim.py`.
- **Balance is now a real single source of truth.** Difficulty & economy numbers
  (tower stats + upgrade deltas, enemy types, the 10-wave table, and the economy)
  moved out of hardcoded constants in `main.js` into `data/balance.json`. The
  game now reads them from `window.BALANCE`, sourced from the JSON via a
  generated `balance.data.js` (so the game still runs when you double-click
  `index.html` — a `fetch()` would be blocked on `file://`). Run
  `python3 tools/gen_balance.py` after editing the JSON. `tools/balance_sim.py`
  was rewritten to model the real 5-tower game (combat, upgrades, economy) from
  the same file — so the sim's win-rate finally reflects what players face. The
  shipped config reads BALANCED (~60% for the reference strategy, in the 45–60%
  band). Art (colors/shapes) and level geometry (path, slots) stay in `main.js`.
  Files: `data/balance.json`, `balance.data.js` (generated), `tools/gen_balance.py`,
  `tools/balance_sim.py`, `main.js`, `index.html`.

### Fixed
- **iPhone landscape clipping.** On a real iPhone in Safari, rotating to
  landscape clipped the top and bottom of the game off-screen — the previous
  fix relied on a flexbox percentage-height chain (`canvas { height: 100% }`
  inside a `100dvh` flex column) that desktop browsers resolve but iOS Safari
  does not, and `dvh` let the canvas size into the strip Safari's floating
  toolbars sit over. Reworked so the canvas sizes ITSELF from the viewport:
  `width: min(100%, (100svh − chrome) * 16 / 9)` with height derived from the
  locked 16:9 ratio — no flex height chain, and `svh` (viewport *with* Safari's
  bars showing) guarantees nothing hides behind the toolbars. Both orientations
  now fit fully and switch cleanly on rotation; also added left/right
  safe-area-inset padding for the landscape notch. File: `style.css`.
  (Note: a web page can't force/lock orientation in iOS Safari, so the phone's
  own rotation is the switch — but portrait and landscape both work now.)

### Added
- **Overnight polish pass** — a full headless run-through (via a script driven
  in a real browser context, stepping `update()`/`render()` through complete
  10-wave runs) confirmed the v1 build with no bugs found, then:
  - **Balance retune.** The old curve let even a 3-tower, no-upgrade build hold
    all 20 lives through wave 9 — all the tension was dumped onto wave 10.
    Lowered `startCurrency` (200→150), raised `upgradeCost` (55/85→70/100),
    lowered `earnPerWave` (45→40) and per-enemy currency rewards (mote 6→5,
    runner 7→5, brute 12→9, swarm 3→2), and steepened the `WAVES` hp/count/
    speed curve so difficulty escalates across the whole run instead of just
    the finale. Verified: a genuinely good build (a handful of well-chosen
    towers, upgraded rather than spread thin across every slot) wins with real
    tension (finishes around 8/20 lives); a weak build (one un-upgraded tower,
    or no towers at all) loses by wave 3.
  - **Juice.** Non-lethal hits now spawn a quick white spark; kills show a
    floating "+currency" popup; the core flashes *and* the screen shakes
    briefly when an enemy reaches it; the HUD lives readout pulses red when
    lives drop to 25% or below.
  - **Mobile landscape fix.** `#game-canvas` only capped width, not height, so
    rotating to landscape overflowed the short viewport. It's now bound by
    *both* dimensions (width-driven in portrait/tall views, height-driven in
    short landscape, via a media query — never both at once, which is what
    was silently stretching the canvas out of its 16:9 ratio during testing).
    Verified at 375×812, 812×375, 844×390, and a 768×1024/1024×768 tablet with
    no overflow or distortion in any of them.
  - **New HUD icons.** The plain ◆/♥ glyphs in `drawHUD` are now small original
    canvas-drawn icons — a warded-shield glyph for lives, a faceted essence
    shard for currency — instead of generic symbol characters.
  - **Richer tower art.** Each of the 5 tower types now has a small original
    ornamental detail layered onto its base shape when placed in-run (arrow's
    nested facet, cannon's stubby barrel, frost's rime spikes, sniper's scope,
    zap's etched bolt), so they read as more than flat silhouettes while
    staying distinct and cheap to draw. Toolbar/hub cards keep the plain
    shapes so they stay legible at small size.
  File: `main.js`, `style.css`.
- **Deck / collection + meta-progression + polish** (Stage 3; Issues #8, #13, #14)
  — completes the v1 loop. New **hub / start screen** showing your card collection
  and an **Essence shop**. Finishing a run earns **Essence** (more for going
  further / winning), which **persists between runs** (saved in the browser via
  localStorage) and can be spent to permanently **unlock the Sniper card** and buy
  starting perks (**+50 currency**, **+3 lives**). Your **deck** = the tower cards
  you've unlocked; the in-run toolbar shows only those (in-run card management kept
  light for v1, per the brief). Runs now flow hub → prep → waves → win/lose →
  run-summary (with Essence earned) → back to the hub. This is the "always
  progressing" pillar: you get stronger across runs. File: `main.js` (+ label
  updates in `index.html`).
- **Content & depth — tower/enemy variety + per-type upgrades** (Stage 2; Issues
  #10, #11, #12). **5 tower types** with genuinely different behaviors, chosen
  from a new bottom **toolbar**: Arrow (balanced single-target), Cannon (splash
  AoE), Frost (slows enemies it hits), Sniper (long range / big hits / slow fire),
  Zap (cheap, fast, weak). **4 enemy types** that waves now mix: Mote (basic),
  Runner (fast, frail), Brute (slow, tanky), Swarm (tiny, many). **Upgrades scale
  each tower's identity** (Frost slows harder, Cannon's splash radius grows, Sniper
  reaches further, etc.). Each tower type also has its own shot sound. Balance is
  still first-pass. File: `main.js` (+ label updates in `index.html`).
- **Core loop — a full playable round** (Stage 1 of finishing the build; covers
  the heart of Issues #4–#7 + #9). Turns the feel-prototype into a real game:
  **build** towers on fixed slots and **upgrade** them by spending **currency**;
  survive **10 escalating waves** with a calm prep phase between them (and you can
  build/upgrade live mid-wave — the "interactive" pacing). Enemies reaching the
  **core** cost **lives**; **win** by surviving all waves, **lose** at 0 lives —
  both with an end screen + "Play again". On-canvas Start Wave button, HUD
  (lives / currency / wave), build & upgrade cost hints, and can't-afford
  feedback. Economy & wave curve are first-pass and **not yet balance-tuned**.
  Keeps the kill/upgrade juice + procedural audio. File: `main.js` (+ label
  updates in `index.html`). Plain canvas, no dependencies.
- **Combat feel-prototype** (on top of #3) — makes two developer ideas playable:
  **juicy upgrade visuals** and **cool, unique kill sounds**. Enemies ("blight
  motes") walk the fixed path; two pre-placed towers auto-target and fire at
  them; hits show health bars and a hurt-flash, kills spawn a particle burst +
  an expanding ring. **Click a tower to upgrade it** (up to level 3) — it visibly
  grows, brightens, gains glow and level pips, and fires faster/harder, with an
  upgrade sparkle + sound. All audio is **generated in-code via the Web Audio
  API** (original, license-clean — no sound files): distinct shoot / hit / kill
  (randomised so it never feels repetitive) / upgrade effects, with a **mute
  toggle** and browser-safe unlock on first tap. Works with mouse and touch.
  NOTE: this is a *feel* prototype — tower positions/stats are hard-coded; real
  placement (#6), currency (#7), waves (#4/#5) and cards (#8+) come next, in order.
  File: `main.js` (plus label/footer updates in `index.html`). Still plain canvas,
  no dependencies.
- **Issue #3 — map & core, game loop.** The canvas now draws the level's single
  fixed path and the **core** (Wellspring) we defend, rendered by a real game
  loop with a stable *fixed timestep* (60 updates/sec, independent of screen
  refresh rate). A small debug readout (fps · elapsed time · update count) and a
  glowing dot travelling the path make it obvious the loop is ticking. The
  travelling dot is only a temporary liveness indicator — not an enemy. Reusable
  path helper (`pointAtDistance`) is ready for enemy movement in #4. File:
  `main.js` (plus label/footer updates in `index.html`). Still plain canvas — no
  new dependencies.
- **Task 1 — project skeleton.** A minimal HTML5 + JavaScript page: a titled
  page ("Deckbound") with a game-canvas placeholder that draws a simple frame
  and title text. No game logic yet. Files: `index.html`, `style.css`,
  `main.js`.
- **Studio Feed workflow** (`.github/workflows/studio-feed.yml`): posts to the
  `#studio-feed` Slack channel on every push and on an hourly heartbeat.
- Project docs versioned at repo root: `PROJECT.md`, `GAME_BRIEF.md`.
- `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `docs/ideas-parked.md`, and a beginner setup guide
  (`SETUP-AND-LAUNCH.md`).
