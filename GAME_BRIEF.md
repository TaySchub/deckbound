# GAME_BRIEF.md — "Blue-Plate Special" (working title)

> **Frozen source of truth for the build.** Chosen at the commitment gate. Ideation is **closed** for this game — new ideas go to `/docs/ideas-parked.md`. Refinements *within* this concept are welcome; scope-expanding additions are parked.

## One-line pitch
A tower-defense deckbuilder: draw tower cards, place them along the path, and survive escalating waves — then collect and upgrade new cards between runs.

## Genre
Tower defense + roguelite deckbuilder. Single-player, 2D, web.

## Design pillars (the feel we're protecting)
1. **Collect & build** — a growing collection of tower cards you assemble into a deck (the "ultimate team" satisfaction).
2. **Escalate & survive** — waves get harder; how far can you get? (the round-based-survival tension).
3. **Always progressing** — you earn and upgrade in every run, and unlock permanently between runs (the steady-reward loop).

## Core loop
**Between runs (meta):** build a deck from your unlocked tower cards; pick a map.

**In a run:**
1. **Prep phase** (no clock): draw a hand of tower cards from your deck; spend currency to place towers along the path and upgrade them.
2. **Wave phase:** enemies march the path toward your core; towers auto-fire. **You stay hands-on** — placing and upgrading towers live while the wave runs.
3. **Resolve:** earn currency from the wave; the next wave is bigger and tougher. Repeat.

You **lose** when too many enemies reach your core. There is no win screen — every run is **endless**: you survive as many waves as you can, and your score is the wave you reach (Issue #75).

**After a run:** unlock or earn new cards, growing your collection for future decks.

## Key design decisions (locked for v1)
- **Pacing (interactive):** a calm **prep phase** to set up, then you stay **hands-on during the wave** — placing and upgrading towers live as enemies attack. This is the fun, interactive version and it's the locked decision.
- **Map:** a single fixed path with free tower placement (obstacle-constrained) for the first version. Maze-building and multi-path maps come later.
- **Where the deckbuilding lives:** mostly *between* runs (which cards are in your deck), plus a hand drawn each prep phase. Complex in-run card management is intentionally kept light for v1.
- **Players:** single-player for v1. (Local co-op is a possible later addition; real-time online multiplayer is out of scope.)

## Theme (open — swap anytime, doesn't affect the build)
**Hungry customers vs. runaway food:** the towers are seated diner customers and the enemies are dishes trying to escape down a conveyor belt before they're eaten. Map 1 is an American diner — food leaves the kitchen (spawn), rides the belt past the tables (towers, placed freely on the diner floor), and any dish that makes it back to the dish return (the core) is wasted, dropping the restaurant's Health Rating (lives). (Early builds used a trash chute; core styling is per-map.) General-audience, Saturday-morning-cartoon tone; original content only. This replaces the earlier arcane-wardens / Wellspring / Blight placeholder under this section's own "swap anytime" clause — genre, pillars, core loop, and milestone scope are unchanged. Full theme detail: `docs/FRANCHISE_BACKBONE.md`.

## First version ("done") — the milestone
A deployable build, openable on a Mac or iPhone via the GitHub Pages link, playable end to end:
- **1 map** (single path) with a core to defend and a lose condition.
- **~5–6 tower cards** with distinct behaviors (e.g. steady single-target, a heavy single bite, freeze-then-slow, fast drain, cheap multi-target).
- **~3–4 enemy types** with escalating stats across **~10 waves**, ending in a clear win.
- The full **prep → wave → resolve** loop with **live in-wave placing/upgrading** and an in-run **currency economy** (earn per wave/kill, spend to place and upgrade).
- A **minimal between-run unlock** (even 1–2 unlockable cards) to prove the meta-progression loop.
- Placeholder art and audio are fine. The bar is that the loop is **fun and stable**, not that it's pretty.

## Explicitly OUT of the first version (parked)
Multiple maps, large card pools, maze/free-path building, online or local multiplayer, monetization, accounts or data collection, and polished art. These belong to later milestones or future cycles.

## Post-v1 additions (developer-approved, beyond the frozen v1)
v1 is complete. The developer has explicitly approved these additions *beyond*
the frozen v1 scope above; they are being built as post-v1 features and noted
here so the brief stays honest:
- **Per-tower targeting priority** — each tower can be set to First / Last /
  Strong / Close, changed live by selecting the tower.
- **Larger map + generated waves** — a longer, more-winding single map (still one
  16:9 map, so multi-map stays parked) and a wave *generator* (`waveGen`) that
  replaces the fixed 10-wave table, producing wave N from a formula with no final
  wave, so a run ends only when the diner is shut down (Issue #75).
- **Endless-only (Issue #75)** — the finite 20-wave win was removed: every run is
  endless and ends only in defeat. There is no hub mode toggle; the HUD wave
  counter has no "/20" ceiling; the run summary and hub surface waves survived and
  a persisted best-wave record. (This resolves the open "keep endless?" decision
  above — in favor of endless-only.)

## Constraints (from the developer profile)
Beginner developer; agents do the building. Web game in HTML5 + JavaScript on GitHub Pages, tested on Mac + iPhone. Phaser 3 if the real-time action warrants it; plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript is fine if simpler. ~12–15 hrs/week. General-audience content. No monetization now (keep it addable later). **Original theme and assets only — no branded or trademarked content.**

## Open design decisions to resolve early in the build (prototype, then freeze here)
- **Card flow:** are unplayed cards kept across waves or refreshed each prep phase? Are played cards spent for the run or reusable? Prototype whichever is most fun and simplest.
- **Currency:** earned per kill, per wave, or both? Starting amount and tower costs.
- **Upgrade model:** linear tower levels vs. branching upgrades.
- **Difficulty curve:** exact wave count and scaling for the milestone map.
